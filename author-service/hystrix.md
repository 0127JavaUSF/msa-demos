# Hystix
Defensive programming, fault tolerance utility that implements a circuit breaker 
design pattern and provides metrics that can be viewed on a 
dashboard for tracking service failures.

Hystrix is part of the Netflix OSS.

A hystrix is a kind of porcupine.

Hystrix is mostly dead. :( However, it's still used a lot in the industry and is
attached to a lot of existing applications.

Note: Hystrix must be enabled at the application level if you want to use it.
